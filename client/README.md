# Booked It!
## An audition tracking app for actors

Booked It! is a React/Rails application to allow actors to track their auditions. As an actor myself, I previously used a (very long) Google Sheet to keep track of all my audition information - with Booked It! the information is more easily accessed. Linked databases store all the information an actor could need (date, time, who was in the room), allowing the actor to easily search for future reference. The application also stores monologues, with the option of uploading a PDF, for reference by either individual users or any user on the platform.
